# Github Playground

Ideal-rotary-phone is a no-consequence repo for trying out Github
features. It is a good place to practice branching and pull reviews.

The repository is visible only to members of the DART Github
team and the occcasional intern or student.

The content is consciously quite silly. This is s to keep the focus on
git and Github without having to think about creating sensible code.
