# Dealing with users

Users are people who use DART. They may also develop their own code and/or scripts.

There are several ways users can communicate with us. 
* User support requests emailed dart@ucar.edu
* Direct email/meeting with DAReS staff
* [GitHub issues](https://github.com/NCAR/DART/issues)
* [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/NCAR/DART/discussions)

GitHub issues are for bug reports and features for the code. If people are using GitHub
issues for support requests, direct the user to dart@ucar.edu and close the issue.
If a GitHub issue is not a clear issue or feature request, you can convert the issue to a 
discussion.

Things we do not have:
* ticketing system (e.g. an email to dart@ucar.edu creates a ticket)
* user forum
