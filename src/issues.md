# Tracking tasks with GitHub issues

GitHub issues are a way to keep track of enhancements, bugs, and
discussions about code. Use issues to:

- Report a [bug](./bug-reports.md)
- Request/Propose a feature

### Labels

GitHub allows issues to be labeled. Here are some you may want to use:

**Bug** : Something is incorrect or not working

**Backburner** : A problem that is very low priority, but might be 
worked on in the future

**Science** : A problem that needs science discussion to be resolved

You may want to add your own labels, for example, if you are working a
lot with WRF, you may want to add the label WRF so you can search for
all issues related to WRF.
