Goal of this document
----------------------

A living document to describe the DART software workflow.  Our current workflow

Things we don't have yet:

* a project management system
* a bug database
* a release schedule

Things we do have:

* standups
* issue tracking via Github
* code review via pull requests on Github
* this much code:
