Tracking tasks
===============


Github issues
-------------

Github issues are a way to keep track of enhancements, bugs, and discussions about code. 


* Report at bug
* Request/Propose a feature


Labels
^^^^^^

Github allows issues to be labeled. 

Bug
  Something is incorrect or not working

Backburner
  A problem that is very low priority, but might be worked on in the future

Science 
  A problem that needs science discussion to be resolved

You may want to add your own labels, for example, if you are working a lot with WRF, you may want to add the label WRF so you can search for all issues realated to WRF.

.. note
   If you are working on an issue, assign yourself the issue on Github.
