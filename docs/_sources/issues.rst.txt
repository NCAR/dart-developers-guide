Github issues
-------------

Github issues are a way to keep track of enhancements, bugs, and discussions about code. 
Use issues to:

* Report a :ref:`bug <bug>`
* Request/Propose a feature


Labels
^^^^^^

Github allows issues to be labeled.  Here are some you may want to use:

Bug
  Something is incorrect or not working

Backburner
  A problem that is very low priority, but might be worked on in the future

Science 
  A problem that needs science discussion to be resolved

You may want to add your own labels, for example, if you are working a lot with 
WRF, you may want to add the label WRF so you can search for all issues related to WRF.

.. note
   If you are working on an issue, assign yourself the issue on Github.
