Reporting Bugs
===============


A bug report should contain the following:

1. The steps someone needs to take to reproduce the bug.

2. What you expected to happen.

3. What actually happened.


Here is an example bug report:

1. Steps to reproduce:

   * Use kroger brand cake mix.
   * Mix 2 cups of water with into the cake mix to produce a batter. 
   * Turn on the NCAR oven in the Mesa Lab. 
   * Bake the batter in a pyrex dish for 20 minutes at 350F.


2. What I expected to happen:

   A cake
   
3. What actually happened:

   Cake batter not cooked at all. 

.. note::
  
    Try to have a reproducer for the bug that is as small as possible. 
    The smallest number of observations, the fewest time steps, the lowest 
    resolution model.
